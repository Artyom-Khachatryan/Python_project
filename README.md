Project Description
In this competition, you are given a list of collision events and their properties. You will then predict whether a τ → 3μ decay happened in this collision. This τ → 3μ is currently assumed by scientists not to happen, and the goal of this competition is to discover τ → 3μ happening more frequently than scientists currently can understand.

Dataset Description

This is a labelled dataset (the label ‘signal’ being ‘1’ for signal events, ‘0’ for background events) to train the classifier. Signal events have been simulated, while background events are real data.

This real data is collected by the LHCb detectors observing collisions of accelerated particles with a specific mass range in which τ → 3μ can’t happen. We call these events “background” and label them 0.
